# hlbrw - assistant to help make new rules to HLBR

  1. WHAT IS HLBRW? HOW IT WORKS?

Please, read the manpage.


  2. HOW TO INSTALL IT?

This program is a script in shell Bash and depends of this:

   * bash (http://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
   * hlbr (http://hlbr.sf.net)
   * iwatch (http://iwatch.sourceforge.net)

To install, type # make install.

You must use the file iwatch.xml.sample as configuration for iwatch program.
Then copy iwatch.xml.sample as /etc/iwatch/iwatch.xml (or other file name if you
know iwatch mechanism). The iwatch.xml file will activate HLBRW when needed.

IMPORTANT: iwatch must be running as daemon.


  3. HOW TO USE IT?

HLBRW will make tcpdump files in /var/log/hlbr. You need analyse that files with
tcpdump or wireshark. The appropriate tcpdump command is:

    # tcpdump -n -S -s0 -A -r <file.dump>

Is very important know frames detected and blocked by HLBR doesn't will arrive
to layer 3 (OSI model). Then tcpdump doesn't see it and is very common the
capture made by HLBRW + tcpdump doesn't show the frames dropped by HLBR. You will
find those frames in hlbr.dump log.


  4. CAN I SEND MY NEW RULES TO HLBR PROJECT?

Yes! We need new rules. You can send good rules to eriberto@eriberto.pro.br. Your
rules will be analysed and if relevant to project, will be put in next version of
the HLBR project. Please, be selective and don't send imperfect or useless rules.

Thanks a lot for use HLBR and HLBRW.
