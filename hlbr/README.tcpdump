You can use tcpdump to read hlbr.dump and virus.dump files (stored in
/var/log/hlbr). To use it, we suggest this command:

   # tcpdump -n -s 1500 -A -r /var/log/hlbr/hlbr.log

If you need to see an especific host activities, use "host IP". Example:

   # tcpdump -n -s 1500 -A -r /var/log/hlbr/hlbr.log host 64.65.66.67

To see others tcpdump examples and options:

   $ man tcpdump
