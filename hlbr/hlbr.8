.SH DESCRIPTION
HLBR is an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that can filter packets directly in the layer 2 of the OSI model (so the machine doesn't need even an IP address). Detection of malicious/anomalous traffic is done by rules based in signatures, and the user can add more rules. It is an efficient and versatile IPS, and it can even be used as bridge to honeypots and honeynets. Since it doesn't make use of the operating system's TCP/IP stack, it can be "invisible" to network access and attackers.
