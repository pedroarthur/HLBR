I'll probably have to redo hogwash_print AGAIN!;P

----------
When hogwash submits info the mysql, is it possible to also enter
additional into the db. The goal is to generate add more detail to
reports if they wish to submit a certain attack for a report etc.

Namely things like perhaps:
tcp info: SEQ number
ACK number
WINDOW number
any Flags the packet may have
the TCP Checksum
TTL
TOS
the Length of the packet
