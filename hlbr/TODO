Current version:

- changes in packet scheduling introduced a new bug - when using MacFilter
  sometimes an interface number 99 is used (means broadcast) and the code
  crashes when trying PacketQueue.Scheduling[packet->TargetInterface]
  and TargetInterface being 99
- finish implementation of the logThread (keeps/updates all logfiles);
   implement function to manage string buffers for messages;
   define KEEP_LOGFILE_OPEN and fix stuff so that works; change
   action_alert_file.c to use LogMessage

Next versions:

- finish documentation at site
- create faq
- Implement other protocol parsing (like, say, checking HTTP options or decoding SMTP)
- Integrate the VoIP code that's currently under "testing" status; maybe re-code stuff
- create some form of rules correlation (like in the Shoki project)
- add possibility of daemon reload
- add rules reload
- create a remote GUI?
- rules, rules and more rules...

The future:

- only God knows...
